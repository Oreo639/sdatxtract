# SDATxtract
A comand line Nintendo ds Sound DATa extraction utility.

# TODO
Add SWAR extraction and swav conversion. Finish nsseq and use that instead of sseq2mid. More testing. This is unfinished and subject to change. If I used your code without crediting you, please let me know either by relevant social media, or by the issue tracker.

# Credits
Vgmtrans: Symb parser prety much riped from them, with minor changes being made to support this codebase ofc.

Loveemu: Sseq2mid and strm2wav are used in this project.

Ndssndext: Largely inspired by ndssndext, however do to the aplication being unlisenced, this application was rewriten.
